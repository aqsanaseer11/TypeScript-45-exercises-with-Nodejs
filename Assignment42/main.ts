//Qno.42:Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified

function show_magicians (magicians : string []){
    magicians.forEach(name=>console.log(name)
    )

}

function make_great(magicians:string[]){
   return magicians.map(name=>`The Great ${name}`)
}

let magician_name = ["David Blaine","Teller","Criss Angle"]

let magician = make_great(magician_name)

show_magicians(magician)
